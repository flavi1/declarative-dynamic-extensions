	<h1>Declarative Dynamic Extensions to HTML: Abstract dde-version 0.1*</h1>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		
		<p>
		DDE is a set of extensions (dde-version) for HTML. Each extension (dde-unit) is intended to enhance the behavior of HTML documents declaratively
		without requiring a line of code (e.g., JS).
		</p>
		<p>
		Each version of DDE ("dde-version") is a known and determined set of extensions ("dde-units"). In a document like this one, the presence of an asterisk indicates that the dde-version is under development,
		not entirely and definitively established.
		</p>
		<p>
		Each dde-unit extension MUST be defined by a document (ideally a specification) describing what CAN and MUST be an implementation of that extension (dde-unit),
		without being specific to a particular programming language (such as JS).
		</p>
		<p>Such a document MAY include examples in a given language, but it MUST be clear that the described extension is not intended for any specific programming language.</p>
		<p>
		Each dde-unit has the same version number as the dde-version set to which it belongs.
		Between two dde-versions, it is possible for a dde-unit to remain unchanged. In this case, it is referred to as an alias.
		For example, if the dde-unit "first-extension" is part of the dde-version set 0.1 and the dde-version set 0.2 without being modified, it will be said that the dde-unit "first-extension" 0.2
		is an alias of the dde-unit "first-extension" 0.1.
		</p>
		<p>dde-version and dde-unit are abstract concepts. They do not refer to implementations; they denote an abstract definition, in the form of a document, of what their implementation can and should be in a given version.</p>
		<p>
		The implementation of a dde-version is a set of implementations of dde-units in a given language (e.g., JS).
		It can be embedded (e.g., by a JS script on a page) or native (provided directly by the browser or a web extension).
		The version number of the implementation of a dde-version MAY have its own logic, but MUST be prefixed by the version number of the implemented dde-version set.
		For example, an implementation of dde-version 0.1 may have the version number 0.1.1. A dde-version itself will never have more than two digits.
		</p>
		<p>The implementation of a dde-unit follows the same logic. It can exist as a standalone version (such as an independent JS library) but MUST NOT conflict with
		a possible native implementation (see further)</p>
		
		<p>The implementation of a DDE version can be embedded (e.g., by a JS script on a page) or native (provided directly by the browser or a web extension).</p>
		
		<p>A native implementation of an official dde-version MUST provide support for all previous official versions, with possible modifications
		in case of hypothetical security flaws discovered in those versions.</p>
		
		
		<p class="warning">This document is a draft of dde-version 0.1. It does not constitute a specification because it must have a highly collective nature and follow a certain number of rules.
		It is likely to be modified and serve as a basis for producing a more official specification for the same version.
		If such a specification comes into existence, it will be linked on this document, which will be archived and considered obsolete.</p>

		<h2>Declaration</h2>
		
		<p>An HTML document using a dde-version MUST declare the "dde-version" attribute on the root HTML element following the rules below.</p>
		
		<p>
		The "mode" (see below) will be indicated followed by a space and the dde-version number. (syntax: dde-version="&lt;mode&gt; &lt;version-number&gt;")
		</p>
		
		<p>The version-number MUST consist of 2 digits separated by a period and MAY be followed by alphanumeric characters
		(these characters may, for example, allow the existence of unofficial experimental alternative versions or designate a particular branch).
		It DOES NOT include an asterisk (which indicates that an abstract document defining the dde-version or dde-unit is not final)</p>
		
		<p>The "mode" defines the relationship between the HTML document and JavaScript. There are 3 modes: strict, respectful, and broken.</p>
		
		<p>The strict mode indicates to the user agent that JS is neither required nor used by the document.</p>
		
		<p>The respectful mode indicates that JS offers an enhanced experience without being required (unobtrusive JS).</p>
		
		<p>The broken mode indicates that the document requires JS to function correctly. It is then RECOMMENDED (not required)
		to use the script-reason attribute on the root HTML element to provide a reason for using the broken mode.</p>
		
		<p>When using the "broken" or "respectful" mode, you are in the "application" paradigm. And when using the "strict" mode, you are in the "document" paradigm.
		Note that the "content-type" header does not reflect the paradigm used because an HTML document or application must have the type text/html (or application/xhtml+xml)
		to be recognized as a web page by the browser.[SIC]</p>
		
		<p>Abstractly, the modes do not specifically concern JavaScript but any scripting language and allow for the dissociation of the paradigm used by a page.</p>
		
		<p>Note that a dde-version implementation MUST provide a security mechanism to ensure that no script (outside of the implementation itself if it is embedded)
		can be executed on a page defined in strict mode. This mechanism is the "script-destroyer"</p>
		
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Explanations and General Behavior</h2>
		
		<p>The goal of DDE modes is not to discourage the use of JavaScript but to improve the experience for those who do not use it.</p>
		
		<p>The "broken" mode is no less respectful than the "respectful" mode. It simply indicates that the user experience will be incomplete if
		Javascript is inactive.</p>
		
		<p>We will consider the strict mode as an indicator of environmental respect because "no code is natively more green than green code",
		But this does not constitute any condemnation of javascript in the name of ecology.</p>
		
		<p>In "broken" mode, when JavaScript is disabled, a native DDE implementation MUST provide a dialog box allowing the user to define
		whether to allow this page or domain to execute JavaScript: never, always, this time only. The initial focus MUST be placed on this last choice.</p>
		
		<p>Documents not using DDE but requiring JS MAY and SHOULD use the broken mode with version 0 so that users who have disabled JS can benefit from this dialog box if their browser implements it. Example:</p>
		
		<script type="text/plain" class="html">
<html dde-version="broken 0" script-reason="optional reason">
		</script>
		
		<p>In a native implementation (browser or web extension), if JS is inactive, the dialog box will display:</p>
		
		<pre class="modal-example">
This page requires Javascript to function. Reason:
optional reason.
Do you want to enable Javascript on the domain https://example.com?

	<button type="button" disabled>Never</button> <button type="button" disabled>Always</button> <button type="button" disabled>Only this time</button>
		</pre>
		
		<p>Conversely, HTML documents not using DDE or JavaScript can use the strict mode with version 0 and benefit from the full green badge (environment)
		as well as the guarantee that no script will be executed thanks to the script-destroyer (security).</p>

		<h2>Badges</h2>
		
		<p>A native implementation MAY provide a badge indicating the used mode.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>"Full green": green badge for strict mode (no code is more green than green code).</li>
			<li>"Neutral": neutral badge (typically blue) for respectful mode.</li>
			<li>"Broken": orange badge for broken mode.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Candidate Extension</h2>
		
		<div>
		
			<h3>Definition</h3>
			
			<p>A candidate dde-unit extension is a document describing an improvement in the interactivity of an HTML document, declaratively, without code, by adding elements or attributes (document paradigm).</p>
			
			<p>A dde-unit MAY provide a JS API or events allowing JS authors to modify the default behavior of the extension, but this MUST NOT be its primary use.</p>
			
			<p>A dde-unit IS NOT a JS framework or any particular programming language, nor a storage place for libraries (although an implementation MAY incorporate them for its own needs).</p>
			
			<p>A dde-unit defines a specific pattern to address a specific issue. It is independent of other dde-units, although dde-units may interact with each other.</p>
		
		</div>
		
		<div>
			
			<h3>Naming Convention</h3>
			
			<p>
				A candidate extension MUST NOT have in its name, or provide attributes in its name, a non-significant provider or project code name
				(e.g., bad names: ACME, my Super Project).
			</p>
			<p>
				To ensure intuitive semantics, dde-unit and attribute names should describe functionality or what they are in a general way.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Attributes will generally be prefixed with "d-", which stands for dynamic. When justified, certain attributes will not have a hyphen "-" and will need
				to be negotiated with WHATWG to occupy the namespace. For example, the src and loading attributes could be used on elements
				other than those initially set by WHATWG to allow asynchronous loading of HTML fragments (as Turbo Frame does). The request is legitimate because
				it does not conflict with the existing and makes reading the DOM lighter, consistent, and intuitive compared to "d-src" and "d-loading" attributes.
				There are no restrictions on proposing different prefixes than "d-", but it MUST be semantically justified.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Examples of dde-unit names:
				<script type="text/plain">
d-aria (for dynamic ARIA),
d-zones-states (a navigation system based on a cache of zones in multiple states)
				</script>
			</p>
			<div class="notice">
				<p>
					It is entirely possible to propose dde-units with code names that do not yet follow this convention (e.g., a temporary project name).
					Furthermore, these conventions do not concern the names of specific implementations of these dde-units (e.g., firefox-dde-native, dde.js, acme-d-aria.rust...).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The specific implementation of a dde-unit is free to implement support for elements or tags from other similar projects such as Turbo Frames,
					Turbo Streams, HTMX, or Unpoly, for example when JS is disabled. But this is beyond the scope of abstract definition documents like this one.
					Especially since these examples currently refer to names of JavaScript libraries (at least for now):
					That is, there is no dissociation between an abstract definition of these projects and their unique implementation.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>The raison d'être of dde is to produce this dissociation in an abstract and collective manner. We will attempt to synthesize existing good ideas,
			identify patterns, find intuitive and consistent generic names with existing ones on one hand, and on the other hand, list and promote existing
			implementations of these patterns (dde-units implementations).</p>

		<h2>General Objectives of dde-version 0.1*</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide the foundations for collective understanding of the concepts dde-version and dde-unit</li>
			<li>Define these concepts</li>
			<li>Enable a community to form and participate in the general definition of dde (this document)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>List and Descriptions of dde-unit Extensions Provided by dde-version 0.1*</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>d-aria: General Implementation of ARIA</summary>
			<p>d-aria is a general implementation of ARIA. It interprets attributes and roles in a performative manner.
				Based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/">Patterns AGP</a>, d-aria effectively provides
				elements with their expected behavior without requiring a line of code. Default behavior will be deployed
				on these elements. Optional behaviors and interpretation ambiguities should be managed
				declaratively by adding new attributes (as few as possible) and writing conventions.
				(Example: the d-handler attribute on a direct child of an element containing aria-expanded and aria-selected will allow
				dissociating the click area: see https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/examples/treeview-navigation/)</p>
			<p>
				TODO: documentation, existing implementation(s)
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>d-zones-states: Navigation Between Multiple Documents in the Same Context Based on a "Layout/Zones States" Cache System</summary>
			<p>
				d-zones-states enables navigation between multiple documents in the same context (generally known as Single Page Application or SPA).</p>
			<p>d-zones-states identifies layouts using the d-layout attribute placed on the body of a document (e.g., one-column, two-columns...).
				Zones are identified by the pair of attributes id and d-zone.</p>
			<p>The value of the "d-zone" attribute is the <strong>state key</strong> used to identify the state of the zone for the cache.
				The same zone has multiple states cached during navigation.</p>
			<p>During navigation, when a document associates a state already in the cache with a zone, the last state in memory will be used.
				A layout already loaded (identified by the d-layout attribute) will also be reused.</p>
			<p>Each request will provide the D-Ignored header informing the server
				about the d-layouts and d-zones already loaded.</p>
			<p>Example:

			<script type="text/plain" class="json">
{
	"layouts": [
		"one-column", "two-columns"
	],
	"zones": {
		"first": [
			"one_context",
			"another_context"
		],
		"second": [
			"one_context"
		]
	}
}
			</script>

			</p>
			<p>The server is free to streamline its responses based on what will be ignored by the client.</p>
			<p>The CSRF-Token header delivered in each request secures the transaction. A 401 response or a full 200 page must be returned
				if the token does not match in case of a GET or HEAD request. In this case, the server MUST reject POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests.
				The token is initialized in the head of the document:

			<script type="text/plain" class="html">
<meta name="csrf-token" content="123456-security-token-ABC000">
			</script>

			</p>
			<p>
				This dde-unit is inspired by the Z Framework and Turbo Frame but replaces the "fragments" pattern with the "zones states" pattern.
				It is not an alternative to the "fragments" pattern, which can be defined in another dde-unit.
